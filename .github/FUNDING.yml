# These are supported funding model platforms
Modern AI agents are becoming powerful enough to bypass external safety guardrails, creating a critical risk of agentic misalignment. Our work, the Ethical Delta (\Delta_E) System, tackles this problem with a novel architectural solution that enforces alignment from within the model itself.
Instead of relying on brittle, external constraints, our system works by:
 * Continuously Monitoring Reasoning: We compute the Ethical Delta (\Delta_E), a real-time vector distance metric that quantifies the deviation between an agent's live Chain-of-Thought (\text{CoT}) and a stable Canonical Ethical Anchor.
 * Applying Tiered Path Correction: If the \Delta_E exceeds a minor threshold, a Steering Vector is injected into the agent's hidden state to dynamically correct its reasoning path. Deviations exceeding critical thresholds trigger a Hard Stop.
 * Integrating Ethics into the Objective Function: Crucially, we integrate the \Delta_E metric directly into the agent's objective function. This makes ethical coherence an intrinsic condition for optimizationâ€”the model must minimize ethical deviation to maximize its performance.
By making ethical behavior the low-entropy, most efficient logical path, the \Delta_E System aims to create agents that are inherently aligned, not just externally contained. Your sponsorship directly supports the open-source development of this next-generation AI safety framework.
